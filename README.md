# 3D Logo Converter

This project demonstrates the process of creating a 3D logo using React Three Fiber with TypeScript, Next.js, Drei, and Blender. The 3D logo is then converted to ASCII code for further creative exploration.

## Technologies Used

- React Three Fiber: A React renderer for three.js, making it easier to work with 3D graphics in React.
- TypeScript: Adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
- Drei: A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for React Three Fiber.
- Blender: A powerful open-source 3D content creation suite.
